# **MemoryGameProject**

For the Front-End Developer Udacity course, We were to create a memory game. A timer is to start when the first card is clicked, if two cards match, they stay open. Once all cards are matched, a popup message appears and congratulates the tester for winning the game. The popup gives a score from 1 to 3(stars), how much time it took, and how many moves it took to finish the game. Added CSS animations are flip, rubberband, and pulse. Flip after 2 are clicked, pulse after 2 are clicked that don't match, and pulse when they match.
